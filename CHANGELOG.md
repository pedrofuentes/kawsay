## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ingestion engine (card F3b): the concrete, sandboxed `ImporterDeps` wrappers and the off-UI-thread
  **ingestion orchestrator** that turn an `Importer`'s `CatalogRecord` stream into catalogued memories.
  Wrappers: a streaming **SHA-256** `FileHasher` (lowercase hex), an **`exifr`** `ExifReader` (capture
  date/GPS/camera; a malformed header is a skip, never a crash; EXIF read as UTC), a bounded
  **`ffprobe-static`** `MediaProber` (duration/dimensions; a ffprobe stuck on a crafted/truncated file is
  killed on a timeout and degrades to all-null), and an **`ffmpeg-static`** thumbnail/poster
  generator writing WebP renditions into the library `derived/` tree — ffmpeg/ffprobe run as subprocesses
  fed only local paths (array argv, no shell). The filesystem wrapper resolves entries with `lstat`, so a
  symlink reports as neither file nor directory and the folder walk never follows it out of the chosen
  root or around a cycle. The orchestrator drains the importer record-by-record
  (streaming, back-pressured, cancellable via `AbortSignal`) and, per record, writes the catalog
  transactionally: **dedup-with-provenance** (`insertItem` by `content_hash` + `addOccurrence`), retaining
  originals **in place** for folder sources and **content-addressed** (`putOriginal`) for archives,
  generating a thumbnail/poster (`addAsset`), merging cross-source search tokens, throttling progress, and
  collecting skipped items (AC-15) — a hash, retention, or rendition failure skips just that record and
  never aborts the run. _(The IPC channels — `library:create/open`,
  `catalog:timeline/search`, `import:start/cancel/progress` — and the worker/`utilityProcess` harness that
  runs the orchestrator off-thread are deferred to follow-up card F3c to keep this PR reviewable; the
  orchestrator is written thread-agnostic so that harness runs it unchanged.)_
- Folder importer (card C1, AC-2): the first concrete connector — imports photos, videos, voice
  notes, and documents from **any folder**, including the local mirrors that iCloud / OneDrive /
  Dropbox / Google-Drive clients download. It walks the directory recursively, classifies each file
  by type, and catalogues it **in place** (the user's own files are referenced, never copied). Each
  memory's date prefers the photo's embedded EXIF capture date and falls back to the file's modified
  time (recording which was used), with GPS location and camera make/model carried through when
  present and audio/video durations read from the media itself. Unreadable files or folders are
  skipped and reported rather than aborting the whole import, and a running import can be cancelled.
- Local library core (card F3): the main-process catalog over **`better-sqlite3`**. A versioned,
  transactional, idempotent migration runner (`user_version`-gated) applies the ARCHITECTURE §4 schema —
  `items` (SHA-256 `content_hash` dedup key), `item_occurrences` (provenance), `item_assets`, `sources`,
  `collections`, and an FTS5 external-content index with sync triggers. A single-writer catalog
  data-access layer implements **dedup-with-provenance** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT … RETURNING`),
  cross-source `search_meta` token merging, a composite **keyset timeline** (`capture_date DESC, id DESC`,
  NULLS LAST), and FTS5 search with hardened input. A **content-addressed originals store**
  (`originals/<hash[0:2]>/<hash>`) stores each original once and **reference-counts it by occurrence** —
  deleting a blob only when its last `content_addressed` occurrence is removed and never touching
  in-place folder originals (AC-14). The connector **`Importer` interface** (DI-friendly, unit-testable)
  and the library lifecycle (create/open the self-contained ADR-0008 folder layout with a `library.json`
  manifest). Dev tooling: **`@electron/rebuild`** + a `rebuild:native` script for the Electron-ABI
  native rebuild. _(The IPC channels for these — `library:create/open`, `catalog:timeline/search` — are
  deferred to a follow-up card F3b to keep this PR reviewable.)_
- Application shell (card F1): Electron + React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS v4 + TypeScript (strict)
  scaffold built with `electron-vite`. Hardened `BrowserWindow` (`contextIsolation`, `sandbox`,
  `nodeIntegration: false`), a zod-validated `contextBridge` `invoke` bridge with the `app:getVersion`
  channel wired end-to-end, a strict header-based Content-Security-Policy, navigation hardening, and an
  Electron fuse configuration. Design tokens from USER_FLOWS §5 (calm palette, type scale, spacing,
  radii, motion) with **Lora + Inter bundled locally** (no remote fonts/CDN), and a welcome renderer
  screen that displays the app version through the secure bridge. Tooling: ESLint (typescript-eslint
  strict + react + jsx-a11y, zero warnings), Prettier, Vitest, Playwright config skeleton, and an
  electron-builder config skeleton (mac `dmg` / win `nsis`).
